Factory Pattern:

1) This is used when the object creration becomes too convoluted.
2) Constructer is not a good idea as as it has to be same Name and Overloading may end up having Optional parameter hell
3) So offloading the responsibility of creating object to another class/method is called as Factory.


Two types of Factory
1) Proper Factory
2) Abstract Factory
